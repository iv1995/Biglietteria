This application allows you to buy tickets 

Before executing it you have to create a database name 'app' and fill all the tables (the database data is available in the Database directory).
You also have to add the password of the root user (if you want to use another user you will have to change the username as well) 
in the application.properties file and in the ConnectionSingleton class inside the com.biglietteria.main.connections package.

There are two users available : 

username : user
password : password

username : admin
password : password
